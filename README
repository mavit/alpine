DISTRIBUTION CONTENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Alpine distribution includes:

alpine     - The Alpine source directory
configure  - Script to set system-specific configuration, defaults
contrib    - Contributed ports and additions
doc        - Documentation directory. The main documentation is
             tech-notes.txt
imap	   - Source tree containing C-Client IMAP implementation
m4         - macros used in the configure process
packages   - Scripts for building packages for various Linux
             distributions
pico       - The Pico and Pilot source directory
pith       - Core functions common to Alpine/Web Alpine
po         - localization data
web        - Source and scripts for web-based version of Alpine

Most of the documentation is in doc/tech-notes.txt. It is not user
level documentation, but there are things in it some users might find
useful.  The directory doc/tech-notes contains source for
doc/tech-notes.txt in HTML format which can be viewed via a Web
pbrowser by opening doc/tech-notes/index.html.

User level documentation for Alpine is contained in the programs
themselves in the form of context-sensitive help.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PRELIMINARIES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this, you have presumably succeeded in extracting
the distribution from the compressed tar archive file, via the
following command, or equivalent:

        tar --xz -xf alpine.tar.xz

Some of the instructions that follow assume that your current working
directory is the alpine-X.XX directory created by the un-tar process
above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD PROCESS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Alpine build process is based on GNU autotools.  On most Unix
systems, generating a suitable Alpine binary from the source
distribution should be as simple as typing the commands:

        ./configure
        make

For a list of configuration options and default Alpine settings type:

       ./configure --help

Note, the included UW IMAP Toolkit used for mailbox access does not
make use of GNU autotools.  However, in most cases Alpine's configure
script should set the appropriate make target and options.  The
targetted OS can be set from Alpine's configure command line, but in
rare cases more significant manual intervention may be required.  If
problems are encountered, see imap/README for more details.

The PC-Alpine build is based on the Microsoft C compiler and
libraries.  The Alpine Team bases builds on Visual Studio 8 from the
command line using the static build.bat batch and makefiles to
generate suitable binaries.

The Web Alpine application requires a few extra, manual steps to get
all the components built and installed.  See web/README for an
explanation of the various components and web/INSTALL for a basic
installation recipe.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTING EXECUTABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The executables produced are:

 alpine The Alpine mailer. Once compiled this should work just fine on
        your system with no other files than this binary, and no
        modifications to your system. Optionally you may create two
        configuration files, /usr/local/lib/pine.conf and 
        /usr/local/lib/pine.info. See the documentation for details.
 
 pico   The standalone editor similar to the Alpine message composer.
        This is a very simple straight forward text editor.
 
 pilot  The standalone file system navigator.

 alpined
        The Web Alpine serveret that is the primary component of 
	Web Alpine 
 
 imapd  The IMAP daemon. If you want to run alpine in client/server
        mode, this is the daemon to run on the server. Installing this
        requires system privileges and modifications to /etc/services.
        See doc/tech-notes for more details.
 
 mtest  The test IMAP client, an absolutely minimal mail client, useful
        for debugging.

 rpload Utility for uploading a local pinerc or address book to an IMAP
	server.

 rpdump Utility for downloading a pinerc or address book to the
	local machine.

 mailutil 
	Utility for performing various operations on mailboxes,
	be they local or remote.

In general "make install" should place alpine, pico and pilot, and
their corresponding man pages, in the proper directory for your
system.  As the remaining binaries are intended for specific uses or
are a component of a larger package, their installation is typically
done by hand.
