    Alpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both
    the inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of
    power users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alpine is based on the PineÂ® Message System, which was developed at
    the University of Washington, and was popular during the 1990s.  It
    is a console application, and can be learned by exploration and the
    use of context-sensitive help.
