Carmel driver notes
-------------------
Set folder-collections=#carmel#[] to configure Pine to use the
carmel driver. You may include other colllections like a directory full
of Berkeley mail folder



Be sure you don't have a file called ".mailboxlist" in your home
directory. If you do the list of mailboxes presented to be by
the c-client will be out of that file rather than by querying each
driver.

If you have files in your home or mail directory, be sure they aren't
called anything that starts with "#carmel#" or %carmel%. They will be
incorrectly included by mail_find for the bezerk and other drivers.

The carmel driver doesn't grab "inbox". This is to allow other drivers
a shot at it. This may or may not work out in the long run.  With the
current version of Pine you must set your inbox-path=#carmel#inbox to
cause the carmel inbox to be used.


Patching/Compilation for Pine
-----------------------------

This set of files and patches was created for Pine 3.85 and the
corresponding version 3.0 of the c-client and 7.63 of imapd. Hopefully
they will continue to work with future versions of all of these. To
apply the patches copy all the files in the subdirectories here (pine,
c-client and imapd) to the corresponding directories in the Pine
source. The run patch on each of the patch files and finally run the
build script in Pine source root directory. This should result in a
pine, pico and imapd binary in the bin directory ready to be
installed. In the c-client directory there will be a bzk2cml binary
for converting a Berkeley format mailbox to a Carmel format mailbox
for the user running the program.

The modifications to the Pine source are minimal. The two parts are
the calls to link in the carmel driver, and the patches to display
BWC-GLYPH text. Nearly all the patches are for the later. One
additional patch is needed to specify the right driver for creating
new mailboxes. This is currently a bit of a hack in Pine and will
hopefully be fixed future versions of Pine. The patches to imapd are
of exactly the same nature as those to Pine.

If some of these patches fail, it's probably due to changes made in
Pine (applying them to some other version than 3.85).  In that cases
the patches will have to be made manually. 


   
Fixed since the version of Sept '92.
------------------------------------
* Updated to conform with the changes in UW internal changes from
  version 3.5X to 3.84. With these changes all the internal Pine calls
  to the c-client are stabilized, possibly except some changes for
  mail_create. This makes the carmel driver trivial to integrate with
  future versions of Pine.

* Driver now checkpoints both carmel and carmel2 indexes. This should
  save the nightly from deleting mail that it shouldn't.

* The driver only defaults messages without any content-type to
  X-bwc-glyph instead of messages that were tagged text/plain. This will
  cause the the glyph to richtext translations not to be applied when
  the message already has a MIME header.

* Some bug fixes to display of BWC-GLYPH text, including bug causing
  periodic core dumps. 

* Handles case where data file for a message is missing properly

* Bug fixes so critical code in driver is properly protected from
  signals and interrupts.

* Bzk2cml utility included to convert Berkeley mail folder into carmel
  folders. 

* Fixed bug causing text of currently viewed message to be redisplayed
  incorrectly after the arrival of new mail.

* Carmel text served up by imapd is tagged type "plain" instead of
  "X-bwc-glyph", though the text is not yet converted to richtext
  and quoted-printable encoded like it should be to work with other
  clients. 


Fixed in the Aug 1 version
--------------------------
* Only creates a maximum of four Carmel index backup files (COD.FUR files)
 
* Folder listing now works with standard IMAP patterns
  
* Carmel index is check-pointed on expunges
 
* Carmel driver checks for new mail with folder name #carmel#inbox
 
* New mail is incorporated on other than inbox

* MIME decoding works properly now

* Safer incorporation of new mail from /usr/spool/mail (carmel2 writes flushed)


Fixed in Aug 23 version
-----------------------
 
* Fetchheader includes the separator so append will work

* Fixed append to get size right and not insert random NULL's, \n's...

* Conversion of glyph format to rich text in imapd


Fixed in Aug 29 version
-----------------------
* Further fixes to append, including full locking

* The #carmel#user#folder syntax now works properly

* Further fixes to imapd to convert to richtext only when appropriate


Fixed in Sep 2 version
----------------------
* Nearly complete conversion from glyph to richtext

* Fixed bug causing lost new mail on quick in/out Pine sessions

* A few related Pine bugs fixed: sorting, wrapping
  

Fixed in Sep 25 version
-----------------------

* Recognizes all messages with subtype beginning with x-bwc-glyph as Glyph text. 
* Saves messages of type x-bwc-glyph-wide in files ending with .wid

* When saving messages, the link is used rather than making a new file

* Glyph messages after 1994 must have the x-bwc-glyph tag to be recognized

* Bug fix to properly display '@' in glyph text

* Incorporation of latest version of c-client (minor bug fixes)



General Features
----------------
* The driver checks the MAIL environment variable for the place to
look for new incoming mail for the "inbox".

(There's a lot more than this, but it's not documented yet)
