These context diffs when applied to pico/tcap.c enable entrance
and exit of "keypad mode".  This mode is especially useful (and 
necessary!) for HP terminals which require this mode to make the 
arrow keys useful.

These changes are based on a bug report submitted by Jochiam Richter
(zjr@rz.uni-jena.de).
