To build the VMS version of pine, just move the VMSBUILD.COM command
script into the top level pine directory.  If the script fails moving
the pine-specific c-client build script (VMSBUILD_CCLIENT.COM) into
place, just copy it by hand into the C-CLIENT.DIR it creates.  This
RENAME was added just prior to release by the pine team and was not
part of the contributed port.
