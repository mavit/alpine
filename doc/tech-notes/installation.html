<H1>Building and Installation</H1>

<H2><A NAME="compile">Compile-time Options</A></H2>

<EM>Alpine</EM>'s UNIX build environment
is based on Autotools (the GNU Build System).
Once you've unpacked the source distribution find the file
<CODE>configure</CODE> in the top-level directory.
You may look at the many options available by typing
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./configure --help
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
or you could just try building with the command
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./configure
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>

followed by

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                make
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>

Note, while the UW IMAP Toolkit (whose c-client
library <EM>Alpine</EM> uses for mailbox access) build is not based on
Autotools, <EM>Alpine</EM>'s configure script should set an
appropriate make target and compilation options for most systems.

<P>

Some of the following can only be set when you build.  Others,
however, can be overridden by command-line flags to <EM>Alpine</EM> or settings in
<EM>Alpine</EM>'s user or system configuration files.
Some of the options which can be set when building: 

<H3><A NAME="ldap-compile">Including LDAP Functionality</A></H3>

By default, the configure script will attempt to find the LDAP library
support for you.
If you are having trouble with LDAP take a look at the configure options
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> --with-ldap-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the root of the LDAP lib/include path.
<DT> --with-ldap-include-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the LDAP include path.
<DT> --with-ldap-lib-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the LDAP library path.
<DT> --without-ldap
<DD> Disable LDAP support.
</DL> <P>

<EM>Alpine</EM> uses LDAPv3 protocol.
When using the LDAPv3 protocol, the results are assumed to be in the
UTF-8 character set, which <EM>Alpine</EM> handles well.
If the LDAP server returns non-ascii data which is not encoded as UTF-8
you will probably run into problems.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="krb5-compile">Including Kerberos 5 Functionality</A></H3>

This works analogously to the LDAP build.
By default, the configure script will attempt to find the Kerberos library
support for you.
If you are having trouble with Kerberos take a look at the configure options
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> --with-krb5-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the root of the Kerberos lib/include path.
<DT> --with-krb5-include-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the Kerberos include path.
<DT> --with-krb5-lib-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the Kerberos library path.
<DT> --without-krb5
<DD> Disable Kerberos support.
</DL> <P>

<H3><A NAME="pine-compile">Other Alpine Compile-time Options</A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> --disable-nls
<DD> Do not use Native Language Support. NLS refers to the use of GNU
gettext utilities to localize a program, in the sense that English
is translated to some other language.
At the time this was written the low-level support for NSL is included
in <EM>Alpine</EM> but no translations have been done.
If there is no translation available, that means that disabling NLS
will make no difference. If you have trouble building which is due
to gettext or libintl you could try this option, or one of the following.

<DT> --with-libintl-prefix[=DIR]
<DT> --without-libintl-prefix

<DT> --with-ssl-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the root of the SSL lib/include path (OpenSSL).
<DT> --with-ssl-include-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the SSL include path.
<DT> --with-ssl-lib-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the SSL library path.
<DT> --with-ssl-certs-dir=DIR
<DD> Specify the path to the SSL certificates directory.
<DT> --without-ssl
<DD> Disable SSL support.

<DT> --without-pthread
<DD> Do not test for nor build with POSIX thread support, which is used
only for the Busy-Cue in the status line at this time.

<DT> --without-smime
<DD> Disable S/MIME support.

<DT> --disable-debug
<DD> Never create debug files.

<DT> --with-smtp-msa=PATH
<DD> Local Mail Submission Agent (sendmail, by default).
<DT> --with-smtp-msa-flags=FLAGS
<DD> MSA flags for SMTP on stdin/stdout (-bs -odb -oem).

</DL> <P>

There are many more options which you can see using the
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
                ./configure --help
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
command.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="imapd-compile">IMAPd Compile-time Options</A></H3>

There are no options or settings required for the version of <EM>IMAPd</EM>
distributed with <EM>Alpine</EM>.  If you need to be doing more complex modifications
to IMAP, then you should pick up the IMAP development package and work
with that code.  The developer's version of IMAP is available for
anonymous ftp from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu"><CODE>ftp.cac.washington.edu</CODE></A>
in the directory <CODE>mail</CODE>.  The file is called <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z"><CODE>imap.tar.Z</CODE></A>. 
Unless it has changed since <EM>Alpine</EM> was released, the directory
<CODE>imap</CODE> in the <EM>Alpine</EM> distribution is the IMAP
development package.
<P>
The c-client library has not been converted to use the
GNU Build System's autotools.
The <EM>Alpine</EM> configure script will try to correctly guess
the arguments needed for the c-client make command and will build
the library, but if you need to change anything you should take a
look at <CODE>imap/docs/BUILD</CODE> for more detailed instructions.
<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="build">Building the Alpine Programs</A></H2>

You may have already compiled <EM>Alpine</EM> and tried it out.  If so, great!  If
not, you should be able to do it without too much trouble by following
these step-by-step instructions: <P>

<OL>

<LI> Make sure you're in the root of the <EM>Alpine</EM> source.  When you type
<CODE>ls</CODE> you should see the following files and directories (or
something close to it): 

<PRE>
aclocal.m4    config.sub    imap        Makefile.am    packages  web
alpine        configure     include     Makefile.in    pico
build.bat     configure.ac  install-sh  mapi           pith
build.cmd     contrib       LICENSE     missing        po
config.guess  depcomp       ltmain.sh   mkinstalldirs  README
config.rpath  doc           m4          NOTICE         VERSION
</PRE>
<P>

<LI> Give the command <CODE>./configure</CODE>
Configure should grind away for a few minutes.  <P>

<LI> When configure is complete, give the command <CODE>make</CODE>.
If make stops and asks

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>
  Do you want to build with IPv6 anyway? Type y or n please:
</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
you should answer with a 'y'.
The compiler should grind away for a few minutes. The <EM>Alpine</EM>
binary will end up in <CODE>.../alpine/alpine</CODE> and the
Pico and Pilot binaries in <CODE>.../pico/pico</CODE>
and <CODE>.../pico/pilot</CODE>. Other binaries you may be interested
in are <CODE>.../alpine/rpdump</CODE> and <CODE>.../alpine/rpload</CODE>
and c-client binaries in the directories <CODE>.../imap/imapd</CODE>,
<CODE>.../imap/ipopd</CODE>, <CODE>.../imap/mailutil</CODE>, and so on.
<P>

<LI> If you need to try again, make sure you're getting a clean start by giving the command
<CODE>make clean</CODE>. <P>

</OL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-unix">Installing Alpine and Pico on UNIX Platforms</A></H2>

Installing <EM>Alpine</EM> and <EM>Pico</EM> is simple.  You take the program files
which you have just transferred or built and you move them to the correct
directory on your system.  Most often the binaries go in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> though sometimes they are placed in
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>.  All the help text is compiled into <EM>Alpine</EM> so there
are no <STRONG>required</STRONG> auxiliary files. Instead of copying the
binaries manually, you may use <CODE>make install</CODE> to install
them. <P>

There are three optional auxiliary files: 
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.info</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>, and
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>.  The file
<CODE>pine.info</CODE> contains text on how to get further help on the
local system.  It is part of the help text for the
main menu and should probably refer to the local help desk or the system
administrator.  If this file doesn't exist a generic version which
suggests ``talking to the computer support staff at your site'' is shown. 
The file <CODE>pine.conf</CODE> is used to set system-wide default
configurations for <EM>Alpine</EM>.  The file <CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> is also
used to set system-wide default configurations for <EM>Alpine</EM>.
The difference
between these two files is that configuration variables set in the
<CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> file may not normally be over-ridden by a
user.  See the section on <A HREF="config.html"><EM>Alpine</EM> Configuration</A>
later in this document for details about
the <CODE>pine.conf</CODE> and <CODE>pine.conf.fixed</CODE> files.  <P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-pc">Installing PC-Alpine</A></H2>

<P>
The PC-Alpine distribution comes as a .zip file.  To install, unzip the
files to a directory where you would like the program to reside.  Modern
Windows versions come with the capability of unzipping .zip files.  Failing
that, you can use one of the many .zip file extractors out there.
Following current Windows conventions, a common directory into which the files
could be extracted would be <CODE>C:\Program Files\PC-Alpine\</CODE>.

<P>
Having extracted PC-Alpine's .zip file to the directory of choice, you can
now run that directory's alpine.exe, which is the actual PC-Alpine program.
For convenience, you could place shortcuts to it on the task bar, start
menu, etc.

<P>
Upon first running PC-Alpine, you may be asked where you would like to
access your Configuration file (called the <I>pinerc</I>).  This
is useful in accessing already existing configuration files, and it
does not matter where this file gets created.  If you are connecting 
to an IMAP server to access your email, it is also possible to store
this Configuration data on that server, which facilitates accessing
the same configuration from multiple machines (in fact, your configuration
may have already been set up this way for use with other <EM>Alpine</EM> programs).

<P>
After having established the location of the configuration file, it may be
necessary to specify a few configuration settings before reading or sending
mail.  You may be prompted for the following (which may also be edited from
the (S)etup (C)onfig screen from the Main Menu):

<LI><CODE>Folder to open as inbox</CODE> (or <I>inbox-path</I>) - This can 
be an inbox residing on an IMAP or POP3 server, or one residing locally. 
An example of an INBOX for an IMAP server is: 
<CODE>{server.example.com}INBOX</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>User-id</CODE>, <CODE>Personal name</CODE>, and 
<CODE>host/domain</CODE>, which are to be used as your email address.

<LI><CODE>SMTP server to forward message</CODE> - You must enter your SMTP
server before you can send any messages.

<P>
At this point, you will be able to read and send email messages.  There are,
however, many more preferences that you can set in the Configuration
screen.
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="install-imapd">Installing IMAPd</A></H2>

When the <EM>Alpine</EM> distribution is built on a UNIX system, the IMAP server
binary, <CODE>imapd</CODE>, is compiled.  Installing <CODE>imapd</CODE>
requires placing the binary in the appropriate directory, usually
<CODE>/usr/etc</CODE>, and adding entries to <CODE>/etc/services</CODE>
and <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> or their counterparts.
<P>
Instead of including installation instructions here we'll just include
a pointer to detailed instructions in the c-client distribution.
Please take a look at the file
<CODE>imap/docs/BUILD</CODE> in the source tree.

programs when a nntp URL is run with <EM>Alpine</EM> set as the
default newsreader.

</DL> <P>
<EM>Alpine</EM>'s personal configuration file
may be in the same directory as the executable, or if that is inconvenient
because the executable is on a shared or read-only drive, then it can be
in a file named by the <CODE>$PINERC</CODE> environment variable, or in
<CODE>$HOME\ALPINE\PINERC</CODE>, where if not set, <CODE>$HOME</CODE>
defaults to the root of the current working drive.  <P>

Most of the other support files key off of the location of the
<CODE>PINERC</CODE> file.  However, in the case of the NEWSRC file, the
path <CODE>$HOME\NEWSRC</CODE> is checked first.  Also, the postponed
messages and interrupted message folders are placed in the default folder
collection, normally in the directory <CODE>$HOME\MAIL</CODE>.  <P>

The location of the following support files may be controlled by variables
in the personal or global <EM>Alpine</EM> configuration file: signature, addressbook
(and its index file), postponed messages, and newsrc.  <P>

<EM>PC-Alpine</EM> uses the following environment variables: 

<DL COMPACT>

<DD> Specifies location of temporary storage area, first one set wins

<DT> COMSPEC

<DD> Specifies shell for external commands. 

<DT> MAILCAPS

<DD> A semicolon delimited list of path names to mailcap files.
