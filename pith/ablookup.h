 * this is not set the entries that match because
 * of an addr match are still included in the list
 * but the actual "addr" element itself is not filled
 * in. That isn't needed by Web Alpine and it does
 * have a cost, though rather small, to fill it in.

/*
 * Values OR'd together in matches_bitmaps.
 * These are not in the same namespace as the flags
 * above, these are just bits for the matches_bitmaps member.
 *
 * If ALC_NICK is set that means there was a prefix match on the nickname.
 * ALC_FULL is a match on the full address.
 * ALC_ADDR is a match on the mailbox@host part of the address.
 * ALC_REVFULL is a match on the Last, First Fullname if the user uses that.
 * ALC_ABOOK means the entry came from an address book entry
 * ALC_LDAP means the entry came from an LDAP lookup
 * ALC_CURR means the entry came from the currently viewed message
 * This is used in both ABOOK_ENTRY_S and COMPLETE_S structures.
