/*
 *  Some notes:
 *
 * The order that the address book is stored in on disk is the order that
 * the entries will be displayed in. When an address book is opened,
 * if it is ReadWrite the sort order is checked and it is sorted if it is
 * out of order.
 *
 * Considerable complexity that previously existed in the address book
 * code has been removed. Cpu speeds have improved significantly and
 * memory has increased dramatically, as well. The cost of the complexity
 * of the lookup file and hashtables and all that stuff is thought to be
 * more than the benefits. See pre-5.00 pine adrbklib.h for the way it
 * used to be.
 *
 * The display code has remained the same.
 * There is also some allocation happening
 * in addrbook.c. In particular, the display is a window into an array
 * of rows, at least one row per addrbook entry plus more for lists.
 * Each row is an AddrScrn_Disp structure and those should typically take
 * up 6 or 8 bytes. A cached copy of addrbook entries is not kept, just
 * the element number to look it up (and often get it out of the EntryRef
 * cache). In order to avoid having to allocate all those rows, this is
 * also in the form of a cache. Only 3 * screen_length rows are kept in
 * the cache, and the cache is always a simple interval of rows. That is,
 * rows between valid_low and valid_high are all in the cache. Row numbers
 * in the display list are a little mysterious. There is no origin. That
 * is, you don't necessarily know where the start or end of the display
 * is. You only know how to go forward and backward and how to "warp"
 * to new locations in the display and go forward and backward from there.
 * This is because we don't know how many rows there are all together. It
 * is also a way to avoid searching through everything to get somewhere.
 * If you want to go to the End, you warp there and start backwards instead
 * of reading through all the entries to get there. If you edit an entry
 * so that it sorts into a new location, you warp to that new location to
 * save processing all of the entries in between.
 *
 *
 * Notes about RFC1522 encoding:
 *
 * If the fullname field contains other than US-ASCII characters, it is
 * encoded using the rules of RFC1522 or its successor. The value actually
 * stored in the file is encoded, even if it matches the character set of
 * the user. This is so it is easy to pass the entry around or to change
 * character sets without invalidating entries in the address book. When
 * a fullname is displayed, it is first decoded. If the fullname field is
 * encoded as being from a character set other than the user's character
 * set, that will be retained until the user edits the field. Then it will
 * change over to the user's character set. The comment field works in
 * the same way, as do the "phrase" fields of any addresses. On outgoing
 * mail, the correct character set will be retained if you use ComposeTo
 * from the address book screen. However, if you use a nickname from the
 * composer or ^T from the composer, the character set will be lost if it
 * is different from the user's character set.
 *
 *
 * Notes about RemoteViaImap address books:
 *
 * There are currently two types of address books, Local and Imap. Local means
 * it is in a local file. Imap means it is stored in a folder on a remote
 * IMAP server. The folder is a regular folder containing mail messages but
 * the messages are special. The first message is a header message. The last
 * message is the address book data. In between messages are old versions of
 * the address book data. The address book data is stored in the message as
 * it would be on disk, with no fancy mime encoding or anything. When it is
 * used the data from the last message in the folder is copied to a local file
 * and then it is used just like a local file. The local file is a cache for
 * the remote data. We can tell the remote data has been changed by looking
 * at the Date of the last message in the remote folder. If we see it has
 * changed we copy the whole file over again and replace the cache file.
 * A possibly quicker way to tell if it has changed is if the UID has
 * changed or the number of messages in the folder has changed. We use those
 * methods if possible since they don't require opening a new stream and
 * selecting the folder.  There is one metadata file for address book data.
 * The name of that file is stored in the pinerc file. It contains the names
 * of the cache files for RemoveViaImap address books plus other caching
 * information for those address books (uid...).

/*
 * The type a_c_arg_t is a little confusing. It's the type we use in
 * place of adrbk_cntr_t when we want to pass an adrbk_cntr_t in an argument.
 * We were running into problems with the integral promotion of adrbk_cntr_t
 * args. A_c_arg_t has to be large enough to hold a promoted adrbk_cntr_t.
 * So, if adrbk_cntr_t is unsigned short, then a_c_arg_t needs to be int if
 * int is larger than short, or unsigned int if short is same size as int.
 * Since usign16_t always fits in a short, a_c_arg_t of unsigned int should
 * always work for !HUGE. For HUGE, UINT32 will be either an unsigned int
 * or an unsigned long. If it is an unsigned long, then a_c_arg_t better be
 * an unsigned long, too. If it is an unsigned int, then a_c_arg_t could
 * be an unsigned int, too. However, if we just make it unsigned long, then
 * it will be the same in all cases and big enough in all cases.

/*
 * The value NO_NEXT is reserved to mean that there is no next address, or that
 * there is no address number to return. This is similar to getc returning
 * -1 when there is no char to get, but since we've defined this to be
 * unsigned we need to reserve one of the valid values for this purpose.
 * With current implementation it needs to be all 1's, so memset initialization

/*
 * The definitions starting here have to do with the virtual scrolling
 * region view into the addressbooks. That is, the display.
 *
 * We could make every use of an AdrBk_Entry go through a function call
 * like adrbk_get_ae(). Instead, we try to be smart and avoid the extra
 * function calls by knowing when the addrbook entry is still valid, either
 * because we haven't called any functions that could invalidate it or because
 * we have locked it in the cache. If we do lock it, we need to be careful
 * that it eventually gets unlocked. That can be done by an explicit
 * adrbk_get_ae(Unlock) call, or it is done implicitly when the address book
 * is written out. The reason it can get invalidated is that the abe that
 * we get returned to us is just a pointer to a cached addrbook entry, and
 * that entry can be flushed from the cache by other addrbook activity.
 * So we need to be careful to make sure the abe is certain to be valid
 * before using it.
 *
 * Data structures for the display of the address book. There's one
 * of these structures per line on the screen.
 *
 * Types: Title -- The title line for the different address books. It has
 *		   a ptr to the text of the Title line.
 * ClickHereCmb -- This is the line that says to click here to
 *                 expand.  It changes types into the individual expanded
 *                 components once it is expanded.  It doesn't have any data
 *                 other than an implicit title. This is only used with the
 *                 combined-style addrbook display.
 * ListClickHere --This is the line that says to click here to
 *                 expand the members of a distribution list. It changes
 *                 types into the individual expanded ListEnt's (if any)
 *                 when it is expanded. It has a ptr to an AdrBk_Entry.
 *    ListEmpty -- Line that says this is an empty distribution list. No data.
 *        Empty -- Line that says this is an empty addressbook. No data.
 *    ZoomEmpty -- Line that says no addrs in zoomed view. No data.
 * AddFirstGLob -- Place holder for adding an abook. No data.
 * AddFirstPers -- Place holder for adding an abook. No data.
 *   DirServers -- Place holder for accessing directory servers. No data.
 *       Simple -- A single addressbook entry. It has a ptr to an AdrBk_Entry.
 *                 When it is displayed, the fields are usually:
 *                 <nickname>       <fullname>       <address or another nic>
 *     ListHead -- The head of an address list. This has a ptr to an
 *		   AdrBk_Entry.
 *                 <blank line> followed by
 *                 <nickname>       <fullname>       "DISTRIBUTION LIST:"
 *      ListEnt -- The rest of an address list. It has a pointer to its
 *		   ListHead element and a ptr (other) to this specific address
 *		   (not a ptr to another AdrBk_Entry).
 *                 <blank>          <blank>          <address or another nic>
 *         Text -- A ptr to text. For example, the ----- lines and
 *		   whitespace lines.
 *    NoAbooks  -- There are no address books at all.
 *   Beginnning -- The (imaginary) elements before the first real element
 *          End -- The (imaginary) elements after the last real element

 *
 * In the top-level display, there are DlcTitle lines or DlcTitleNoPerm
 * lines, which are the same except we know that we can't access the

 * types of Title lines, and Titles within a section are separated by
 * DlcTitleBlankTop lines, which belong to (have the same adrbk_num as)
 * the Title they are above.
 * If there are no address books and no directory servers defined, we
 * have a DlcNoAbooks line. When we are displaying an individual address
 * book (not in the top-level display) there is another set of types. An
 * empty address book consists of one line of type DlcEmpty. An address
 * book without read permission is a DlcNoPermission. Simple address book
 * entries consist of a single DlcSimple line. Lists begin with a
 * DlcListHead. If the list is not expanded the DlcListHead is followed by
 * a DlcListClickHere. If it is known to be a list with no members the
 * DlcListHead is followed by a DlcListEmpty. If there are members and
 * the list is expanded, each list member is a single line of type
 * DlcListEnt. Two lists are separated by a DlcListBlankBottom belonging
 * to the first list. A list followed or preceded by a DlcSimple address
 * row has a DlcListBlank(Top or Bottom) separating it from the
 * DlcSimple. Above the top row of the display is an imaginary line of
 * type DlcOneBeforeBeginning. Before that is a DlcTwoBeforeBeginning. And
 * before that all the lines are just DlcBeginning lines. After the last
 * display line is a DlcEnd.
 *
 * The DlcDirAccess's are indexed by adrbk_num (re-used for this).
 * Adrbk_num -1 means access all of the servers.
 * Adrbk_num 0 ... n_serv -1 means access all a particular server.
 * Adrbk_num n_serv means access as if from composer using config setup.
 *
 * Here are the types of lines and where they fall in the top-level display:
 *
 * (not a visible line)			DlcBeginning
 * (not a visible line)			DlcBeginning
 * (not a visible line)			DlcTwoBeforeBeginning

 * There is a combined-style display triggered by the F_CMBND_ABOOK_DISP
 * feature. It's a mixture of the top-level and open addrbook displays. When an
 * addrbook is opened the rest of the addrbooks don't disappear from the
 * screen. In this view, the ClickHere lines can be replaced with the entire
 * contents of the addrbook, but the other stuff remains on the screen, too.
 * Here are the types of lines and where they fall in the
 * combined-style display:
 *
 * (not a visible line)			DlcBeginning
 * (not a visible line)			DlcBeginning
 * (not a visible line)			DlcTwoBeforeBeginning
 * (not a visible line)			DlcOneBeforeBeginning
 * --------------------------------	DlcTitleDashTopOld

 * (not a visible line)			DlcEnd
 *
 * If there are no addrbooks in either of the two sections, or no Directory
 * servers, then that section is left out of the display. If there is only
 * one address book and no Directories, then the user goes directly into the

 * The config screen view is similar to the top-level view except there
 * is no directory section (it has it's own config screen) and if there
 * are zero personal addrbooks or zero global addrbooks then a placeholder
 * line of type DlcPersAdd or DlcGlobAdd takes the place of the DlcTitle
 * line.
