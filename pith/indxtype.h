/*
 * Flags for msgline_hidden.
 *
 * MH_NONE means we should only consider messages which are or would be
 *   visible in the index view. That is, messages which are not hidden due
 *   to zooming, not hidden because they are in a collapsed part of a
 *   thread, and not hidden because we are in one thread and they are in
 *   another and the view we are using only shows one thread.
 * MH_THISTHD changes that a little bit. It considers more messages
 *   to be visible. In particular, messages in this thread which are
 *   hidden due to collapsing are considered to be visible instead of hidden.
 *   This is useful if we are viewing a message and hit Next, and want
 *   to see the next message in the thread even if it was in a
 *   collapsed thread. This only makes sense when using the separate
 *   thread index and viewing a thread. "This thread" is the thread that
 *   is being viewed, not the thread that msgno is part of. So it is the
 *   thread that has been marked MN_CHID2.
 * MH_ANYTHD adds more visibility. It doesn't matter if the message is in
 *   the same thread or if it is collapsed or not. If a message is not
 *   hidden due to zooming, then it is not hidden. Notice that ANYTHD
 *   implies THISTHD.
