README FOR DIRECTORY: pith/osdep/

  Modules in this directory should provide OS-independent interfaces
for various OS-dependent methods of getting at resources or whatever.
They should compile on their own without pine, c-client or pico 
dependencies.

NOTES:

  "_WINDOWS" currently differentiates windows from unix code.

  "BUG:" comments mean there's something that needs to get worked on
