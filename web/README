WEB ALPINE
----------

Web Alpine is the web-based component of the Alpine Mail System.  It
rests on the same distributed email technology behind Alpine, but is
accessible from almost any browser on the World Wide Web.

Web Alpine uses TCL to provide the programmatic interface between
the Alpine-provided message store and the cgi-served web pages.


REQUIRED SOFTWARE
-----------------

  Base system:
	C compiler
	Tcl scripting package and development tools
	OpenSSL
	Apache web server (though, presumably any CGI supporting
	                   web server should work)

  Optional:
	ispell application
	  Used to support composer spell check functinoality.
	  Featured not offered if ispell not present.

	openLDAP
	  Provides LDAP query services to support login
	  personalization and user-session LDAP query support.

	UW Pubcookie
	  Provides central web-login management.  Note, additional
	  configuration and installation steps are required.  See
	  src/pubcookie/INSTALL for specific instructions.

	Kerberos 5
	  Required by UW-Pubcookie to provide authentication and
	  proxy authorization for IMAP server access.  Proxy
	  authentication only tested under UW imapd.

 

BUILING AND INSTALLING WEB ALPINE
---------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for basic instructions.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

User documentation is contained within the application and is
reasonably complete.  Technical documentation is extremely rough and
likely unsatisfying.  It's probably worth reading, but ultimately
configuration or other questions are best answered by reviewing the
source (which itself, while working reasonably, is somewhat spotilly
documented as well).


SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK
--------------------
