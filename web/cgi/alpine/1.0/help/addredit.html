<font size="+2"><b>Address Book Entry</b></font>

<p>You can add and edit individual and group entries to your address book by adding information to
the following fields:</p>

<P>
<ul type="square">
 <li><a href="#nick"><b>Nickname</b></a></li>
 <li><a href="#fullname"><b>Full Name</b></a></li>
 <li><a href="#addresses"><b>Addresses</b></a></li>
 <li><a href="#fcc"><b>Fcc</b></a></li>
 <li><a href="#comments"><b>Comments</b></a></li>
</ul>

<a name="nick"><b>Nickname</b></a><br>
Enter a nickname which will identify this address book entry.  Every
address book entry needs to have a unique nickname associated with it.  
While composing a message, you can use the nickname in place of the address.
By clicking <input type=submit value="Expand">, the nickname will automatically by replace by 
the full address or addresses for this entry. The nickname is not seen in the outgoing message.

<p><a name="fullname"><b>Full Name</b></a><br>
Enter the full name for this entry. For an
individual entry, you will ordinarily use that person's name.  For a group
of addresses (or distribution list), use a descriptive word or phrase 
that describes the group.

<p><a name="addresses"><b>Addresses</b></a><br>
Enter the email address or addresses for this entry.  You must complete this field for all your
address book entries.  You can create group mailing lists for sending
email messages to several addresses at once by listing the addresses
separated by commas, just as you would enter them when composing a
message.  For those addresses already in your address book, you can just
add the nicknames separated by commas.

<p><a name="fcc"><b>Fcc</b></a><br>
When the "Fcc:" (Folder carbon copy) field is used, a copy of all messages
that you send with this addressbook entry as the first address in the
"To:" field will be saved in the folder specified in the "Fcc:" field
rather than your default Fcc folder (usually "sent-mail").

<p><a name="comments"><b>Comments</b></a><br>

This optional field allows you to enter any comments about the entry. This field is not used in your
outgoing messages.
