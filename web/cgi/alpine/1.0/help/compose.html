<p>The Message Compose screen is where you will write and send your email 
messages.</p>

<ul type="square">
 <li><a href="#header"><b>Using your header fields</b></a></li>
 <li><a href="#write"><b>Writing your messages</b></a></li>

<a name="header"><b>Using your headers</b></a><p>

The message header area is used for addressing your message and providing
other information that may be useful to you or the message recipient.

<p>By default, your messages headers will include: To, Cc, 
Attachments, Subject. Go to <b>Configure</b> from the Message View or List
page and click the Composer tab to change 
the defaults or customize your settings.  If you have additional headers 
configured, click <img src="../../images/hdrmore.gif" alt="More Headers" 
style="background-color:#ffffcc;padding:4;vertical-align:middle; xborder: 1px solid brown"> to 
display them.
Below is a description of commonly used headers:

<ul>
<li>
<b>To:</b> Use this field to specify intended email recipients.  This can 
be done in any of three ways:
<ul type="square">
 <li>Type the full email address of the intended message recipient. 
Separate multiple addresses with a comma.</li>

 <li>Type a name or nickname specified in your address book and click 
<input type=submit value="Expand">. Alpine will not automatically expand 
your addresses without this step.  Separate multiple names or nicknames 
with a comma.</li>

 <li>Click <img src="../../images/book.gif" alt="Address book icon" 
style="vertical-align:middle"> to go to your address book to select an 
address.</li>
</ul></p></li>

<li> <b>Attachments:</b> Use this field to attach files (such as 
documents,
images, audio clips) to your message.  Click <input type=submit 
value="Attach"> to find and attach a file
from your local system.  If you have attached a file that you do not want 
to send,
click the corresponding <img src="../../images/but_remove.gif" alt="remove 
icon" style="vertical-align:middle"> to
remove it. <p></li>

<li><b>Subject:</b> Use this field to provide a few words that summarize 
the message.<p></li>

<li><b>Cc:</b> (Carbon copy) This field is similar to the "To:" field, but 
it is used to send a copy of the message to one or more people.  These 
email
addresses will be seen by all message recipients.<p></li>

<li><b>Bcc:</b> (Blind carbon copy) This field is similar to the "To:" and 
"Cc:" fields, but it is 
used to send a copy of the message to one or more people whose
addresses you do not want disclosed to other message recipients.<p></li>

<li><b>Fcc:</b> (File carbon copy) Use this field  to specify the folder 
to which a copy of your
outgoing message will be saved.  When this header is visible, you can
change or remove the Fcc by editing the folder name.<p></li>

<li><b>Reply-To:</b> Use this field when you would like replies to your
messages to be directed to an address other than your usual "From:"  
address.<p></li>

</ul>

<a name="write"><b>Writing your messages</b></a><p>

Type your message in the large text box beneath the headers.  Depending on
your browser, messages you send may contain a single long line rather than
the nicely wrapping text shown in the text box.  In those cases,
recipients will have to scroll horizontally to read your message.  To
avoid this problem, use the Return key at the end of each line.

<p>To spell check your message, click the
<input type=submit value="Spell Check"> button.  The resulting page will list each
potentially misspelled word.  Each word will have a text box for you to 
enter a correction.  Additionally, some words will also have
a list of suggested corrections.  Click the <i>Apply</i> button to have 
your changes appear in the composer, or
<i>Cancel</i> to return to the composer with the original text.
</p>

<p>Do you want to add a personalized signature line to your messages?  Go
to <b>Configure</b> from the Message View or List page and click the Composer tab.</p>


<a name="send"><b>Sending, postponing, canceling</b></a><p>
To send your message, postpone it to resume later, or to cancel it 
completely, click the appropriate radio button and then click <input 
type=submit value="OK">.
<ul>
 <li><b>Send</b> - Use this option to send your message to the 
recipients.<p></li>
 <li><b>Postpone</b> - Use this option to store an unfinished message 
without sending it.   To finish the message at a later time, click 
<b>Resume</b> in the far left column of the Message List.<p></li>
 <li><b>Cancel</b> - Use this option to throw out the current composition.  
The message will not be sent and you will not be able to resume 
it.<p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="note"><b>Differences from Pine and PC-Pine</b></a><p>

<p>Alpine is designed primarily for easy access to email.  It is not
intended to replace any other heavy duty email programs.  Accordingly, it
is missing some of the more advanced features you will find in Pine and
PC-Pine. As development continues, features will be added as long as they
do not make a large impact on Alpine's speed or efficiency.

<p> Some of the features you will not currently find in Alpine Compose:
<ul>
<li>Lcc (List carbon copy)
<li>Where is (instead, use your browser's "find" command)
<li>Read a file into the composition
</ul>

</ul>
</form>
