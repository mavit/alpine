<font size="+2"><b>Folder List</b></font>

<p> Your email messages are stored in folders.  The Folder List screen allows you to
get to those folders by clicking on the folder name.  Manage your folders by doing
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete a folder:  Click the radio button corresponding to the correct
folder and click <img src="../../images/but_folddel.gif" alt="delete icon" style="vertical-align:middle">. 
You will be prompted for confirmation before the folder is actually deleted.</li>
<li>Rename a folder: Click the radio button corresponding to the correct
folder and click 
<img src="../../images/but_foldren.gif" alt="folder rename icon" style="vertical-align:middle">.  
You will be prompted for confirmation before the folder is actually renamed.</li>
<li>Add a folder: Click <input type=submit value="Create New..."> to go to the Folder Creation 
screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your folder list includes directories (used to contain folders) or
collections (used to organize folders on different email hosts), you will
see the following icons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click <img src="../../images/b_plus.gif" alt="expand icon"> to expand the listing to see the contents</li>
<li>Click <img src="../../images/b_minus.gif" alt="contract icon"> to collapse the listing and see the top-level only</li>
</ul>
