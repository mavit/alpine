<font size="+2"><b>Message List</b></font>

<p>Your Message List contains summary information about each of the messages in
your current Alpine folder and provides ways for you to take actions on
those messages.</p>

<p>To compose a new message, resume a postponed one, or go to another folder,
click the appropriate option in the far left column of your page.
You will also see options to change your Alpine configuration and to
manage your address book.</p>

<a name="read"><b>Reading your mail</b></a><p>

After logging into Alpine, you will see your Message List INBOX.  This is the default folder for new
mail. To read a message, click its subject.

<p>Click <b>Folder List</b> if you want to read mail within a different folder.</p>


<a name="navigate"><b>Navigating your list</b></a><p>
In the column on the left side of your Message List page, you will
see four navigation options: <b>Previous</b>, <b>First</b>, <b>Next</b>,
<b>Last</b>.
<table border=0 cellpadding=4 style="margin-left:24">
 <tr>
  <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_prev3.gif" alt="Previous"></td>
  <td>to display messages in the current folder before those currently listed</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_first3.gif" alt="First"></td>
  <td>to display messages in the current folder beginning with message 1</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_next3.gif" alt="Next"></td>
  <td>to display messages in the current folder after those currently listed</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_last3.gif" alt="Last"></td>
 <td>to display messages in the current folder at the end of the list</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>With most browsers and the usual settings, you also have the option of 
using keyboard controls for some of your navigation. You may, however, 
need to first click in your Alpine window to make sure that your system 
knows which screen is active. 

<p>The keyboard controls are: 
<table border=0 cellspacing=12 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td text align="center">n</td>
  <td>next message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">p</td>
  <td>previous message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">i</td>
  <td>return to message index</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">c</td>
  <td>compose new message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">l</td>
  <td>list folder</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">d</td>
  <td>flag message as deleted</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">u</td>
  <td>unflag message as deleted</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">a</td>
  <td>go to address book</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">r</td>
  <td>reply to current message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">f</td>
  <td>forward current message</td></tr>
</table>


<a name="scroll"><b>Scrolling through messages</b></a><p>
You have the option of scrolling, rather than paging using <i>Next</i> and
<i>Previous</i>, through most of your messages in your Message List.  Go
to <b>Configure</b> on the left side of your Message List page, click the
Message List tab and enter a higher number in the <i>Message Lines
Displayed</i> field.  Bear in mind that the higher
number you choose, the longer it may take Alpine to open your folders.


<p><a name="sort"><b>Sorting your mail</b></a><p>
To sort your mail, the List Headers Bar must first be displayed.  Display the bar by clicking
the <img src="../../images/baropen.gif" alt="small arrow"> icon
near the top of the screen.

<p>Using the Sort options, you can arrange your mail by <b>Date</b>,
<b>From</b>, <b>To</b>, <b>Size</b>, <b>Subject</b>, <b>Ordered
Subject</b>, and <b>Thread</b>.  Click:
<ul>
 <li><b>Date</b> to sort by the date your messages were sent.</li>
 <li><b>From</b> to sort alphabetically by the email address of the sender of the message.</li>
 <li><b>To</b> to sort alphabetically according to the "To:" line.</li>
 <li><b>Size</b> to sort by the number of characters in the message.</li>
 <li><b>Subject</b> to sort alphabetically according to the "Subject:" line.</li>
 <li><b>Ordered Subject</b> to group messages with the same "Subject:" line and put them into date order.</li>
 <li><b>Thread</b> to present messages as a continuous chain grouped by "Subject:" line.  This sort is particularly helpful when viewing newsgroups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have sorted your mail, the name of that sort (i.e. the column
heading) will be highlighted and an arrow will appear next to the name. To
reverse the sort order, click the arrow.
By default, your Message List is set to sort your mail by arrival time.
</p>

<!--<p><i>{Do you want to change your default sort order? <a href="">Click 
here</a> for that configuration option.[not implemented yet]}</i></p>-->

<a name="delete"><b>Deleting messages</b></a><p>
<ul>
 <li>Click the checkboxes next to the appropriate messages</li>
 <li>Click <input type=submit value="Delete">.  All messages with a mark in the checkbox will be flagged for deletion.  (If you notice that some messages are  mistakenly flagged for deletion,  click their associated checkboxes and click <input type=submit value="Undelete">)</li>
 <li>Click <input type=submit value="Expunge"> to permanently remove from your folder all the messages that have been flagged for deletion</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to delete several messages at once that share a similar
attribute, you might want to first perform a search.  See the 
<a href="#search">Searching</a> text for more information.</p>

<p>Note: if marking a message for deletion fails to work it may be because
you recently used your browser's "Back" button.  To avoid this, be sure to 
Alpine links and navigation options.


<!-- <p><i>{Do you want to Expunge without being prompted for a
confirmation? <a href="">Click here</a> to change that configuration
option. [not implemented yet]}</i>
<p>{<i><a href="">Click here</a> to enable aggregate commands to have
this option available on this page. [not implemented yet]</i>}</p> -->

<p>
<a name="expunge"><b>Removing deleted messages</b></a><p>
Flagging messages for deletion is only half the process of actually removing the messages from the folder altogether.
Click <input type=submit value="Expunge"> to permanently remove messages flagged for deletion.  Because removed messages cannot
be restored, you will be prompted to confirm your desire.  At the prompting click:</p>

<p><input type=submit value="Expunge"> to permanently remove the messages you have flagged for deletion.  You will
not be able to retrieve your messages once you have expunged them. </p>

<p><input type=submit value="Cancel"> to return to your list of messages.  The messages you previously flagged for
deletion will remain in your folder, still flagged for deletion.</p>


<p> <a name="save"><b>Saving messages to another folder</b></a>
<p>

To save messages from your Message List, the Message Command Bar must
first be displayed.  Display the bar by clicking the <img
src="../../images/baropen.gif" alt="small arrow"> icon near the top of the
screen.  Then, click the checkboxes next to the messages you want to
save to another folder (or click just one checkbox if you are only
saving that one message).

<p>
Save the chosen messages by choosing from the options in the dropdown menu next to the
<input type=submit value="Save"> button.  Among the Save options, you'll find:

<ul>
 <li> The name of the default folder to save to, typically <font face="courier">saved-messages</font>.
 <li> Several, typically six, names of folders you have most recently saved messages to
 <li> An option to type in directly the name of the folder you wish to save to (either a new folder you wish to create, or one
already containing messages)
 <li> An option to choose the folder from the list of all your folders
</ul>

If Alpine does not act on your choice immediately, click the <input type=submit value="Save">
button to initiate saving.  Once saved, the chosen messages will be marked for deletion.

<p>

<!---Config option for Collection lists?-->

<a name="flags"><b>Setting status flags</b></a><p>
By default, the area immediatly to the left of the message numbers is reserved for the following status flags:
<table border=0 cellpadding=4 style="margin-left:24">
 <tr>
  <td><font face=Courier><b>+</b></font></td>
  <td>message has your address in the To: line [Note: this is a fixed value]</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><font face=Courier><b>*</b></font></td>
  <td>(Important) - You have previously set the status of this message to important</td>
 <tr>
 </tr>
  <td><font face=Courier><b>A</b></font></td>
  <td>(answered) - You have replied to this message</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><font face=Courier><b>N</b></font></td>
  <td>(new) - You have not yet looked at the text of this message</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><font face=Courier><b>D</b></font></td>
 <td>(deleted) - You have marked this message for deletion, but not yet expunged it</td>
 </tr>
</table>

To add or remove the status flags, the Message Command Bar must first be
displayed.  Display the bar by clicking the <img src="../../images/baropen.gif"
alt="small arrow"> icon near the top of the screen. Then: <ul>
 <li>Click the checkboxes next to the appropriate messages</li>
 <li>Choose the appropriate value from the dropdown menu</li>
 <li>Click <input type=submit value="Set"></li>
</ul>


<!--Config option for enabling status w/click-->

<a name="search"><b>Searching</b></a><p>

To search, the Message Command Bar must first be displayed.  Display the bar
by clicking the <img src="../../images/baropen.gif" alt="small arrow"> icon
near the top of the screen.

<p>Click <input type=submit value="Search"> to get to a page where you can find messages by
text, date, or status.</p>

After you specify your search criteria, you will be returned to your
Message List.  If matches were found, your Message List will display your
found messages and those messages will be marked. (Be aware: by default
Search will include messages marked before the search along with your
search results.)  Click <input type=submit value="Show All Messages"> to display your entire Message 
List.

<p><a name="jump"><b>Jump Command (optional)</b></a><p>

Depending on your configuration, you may also see a text box next to a 
<input type=submit value="Jump"> button on the left side of the page.  Enter a
message number into the text box and click the button to redisplay
the Message List with the chosen message at the top of the page.

<p>
You may find message numbers on the Message List lines make this command more useful.
If not displayed in the Message List, you can add message numbers to each line by
going to <b>Configure</b> on the left of the Message List page, clicking the
Message List tab and adjusting the Message Line Format accordingly.

<p><a name="note"><b>Differences from Alpine and PC-Alpine</b></a><p>

<p>Alpine is designed primarily for easy access to email.  It is not
intended to replace any other heavy duty email programs.  Accordingly, it
is missing some of the more advanced features you will find in Pine and
PC-Pine. As development continues, features will be added as long as they
do not make a large impact on Alpine's speed or efficiency.

<p> Some of the features you will not currently find in Alpine Message
List: <ul> 
<li>Go directly to a folder you type in (may be added soon)
<li>Export message

</ul>
<!--Go to Configure to change the view display after search default-->
