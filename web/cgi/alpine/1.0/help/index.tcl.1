  take actions on those messages.
}

  To compose a new message, resume a postponed one, or go to another

  Using the Sort options you can arrange your mail by [cgi_bold "Date"],
  [cgi_bold "From"], [cgi_bold "To"], [cgi_bold "Size"], [cgi_bold "Subject"], [cgi_bold "Ordered Subject"],
  and [cgi_bold "Thread"].  By default, your Message List is set to
  sort your mail by arrival time. Most of the time, arrival time and date
  (effectively departure time)  are nearly the same. They may differ,
  however, because of messages may take a long time in delivery or because
  of time zone differences.
}


cgi_puts "Select:[cgi_nl]"
cgi_button_list {
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "Date"] to sort by the date your messages were sent.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "From"] to sort by the name of the sender of the 
message.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "To"] to sort your messages alphabetically according to the "To:" 
line.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "Size"] to sort by the number of characters in the message.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "Subject"] to sort your messages alphabetically according to the 
subject line.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "Ordered Subject"] to group messages with the same subject name and 
put them into date order.<br>
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "Thread"] to present messages as a continuous chain grouped by 
Subject.  This sort is particularly helpful when viewing newsgroups.</ul>

cgi_p
Once you have sorted your mail, the name of that sort (i.e. the column
heading) will be highlighted and an arrow will appear next to the name. To
reverse the sort order, click the arrow.</p>

cgi_p
cgi_anchor_name "aggregate">[cgi_bold "Operating on a set of messages"]</a><br>

cgi_p
Operating on a set of messages is referred to as [cgi_italic "aggregate operations"].
The way you perform aggregate operations is by placing a mark in the checkbox on
the line associated with the desired message, 
and then choosing the operation to perform such as deleting or setting 
other message flags, or saving them to a folder.

cgi_p
The set of aggregate operations are either hidden or exposed.  When
hidden you will see a <img src=../../images/slideout.gif style="vertical-align:middle"> tab on the left edge of the line
containing the sort names. Click the tab to expose the aggregate
commands and the checkboxes next to each message.  Similarly, when aggregate operations are visible, you will see a 
<img src=../../images/slidein.gif style="vertical-align:middle"> tab on the line containg the sort names.  You can click this
tab to hide aggregate operations.

cgi_p
When aggregate commands are exposed, the set of commands available is either
simple or complete.  The simple set consists of only the ability to [cgi_bold "Delete"]
messages.  When the simple mode is in effect, you will see a [cgi_bold "Delete"] button
and next to it the <img src=../../images/tabmore.gif style="vertical-align:middle"> tab
above the column of checkboxes. Click the <img src=../../images/tabmore.gif style="vertical-align:middle"> tab
to expose the complete set of commands.

cgi_p
When the complete set of commands is visible, a <img src=../../images/tabless.gif style="vertical-align:middle">
tab will be on the sort name row.  Click it to return to the simple aggregate command set.

cgi_p
The complete set of aggregate operations adds an additional display line above the sort names row.
It contains the [cgi_bold "Flag"] and [cgi_bold "Save"] commands.  The choices above the checkbox column will change
as well into a dropdown list of alternative methods for setting or unsetting checkboxes.  

cgi_p
There are three ways to mark a message when the complete mode is in effect:</p>
<ul>
  cgi_li "Select the checkbox next to the message or messages
  cgi_li "Perform a Search using the [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] menu
  cgi_li "Select [cgi_italic "Mark All"] from the [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] menu. 
</ul>

cgi_p
Lastly, the dropdown will offer a [cgi_bold "Zoom"] option.  Choosing it will change the Message List by
hiding all of the unchecked messages from view.  This is useful, for example, to examine a Search result
that may have marked only a few messages in a large folder.

<!-- <p><i>{<a href="">Click here</a> to enable or disable aggregate
commands from this page.  [not implemented yet]}</i></p> -->

cgi_p
cgi_anchor_name "delete">[cgi_bold "Deleting Messages"]</a><br>
When you see the [cgi_bold "Delete"] option in the upper-right corner of
your Message List page, to delete messages:
<blockquote>
<ul>
  cgi_li "Select the checkboxes next to the appropriate messages
  cgi_li "Select [cgi_bold "Delete"]
  cgi_li "Select [cgi_bold "Expunge"] to remove the messages from your folder
</ul>
</blockquote>

When you are showing all of your aggregate operations (i.e. you 
will see the [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] menu and the "Set Message Status" and 
"Save Messages" operations), to delete:
cgi_division style=
<ul>
  cgi_li "Select the checkboxes next to the appropriate messages by either
selecting them individually or use the [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."]
menu options
  cgi_li "Select [cgi_bold "Flag"] messages as Deleted
  cgi_li "Select [cgi_bold "Expunge"] to remove the messages from your folder.
</ul>
</blockquote>

cgi_p
If you do not see checkboxes to the left of your messages, all of your
aggregate operations are hidden.  Click the tab to the left of your column
sort names to show [cgi_bold "Delete"], then click the tab next to [cgi_bold "Delete"]
if you want to see all the aggregate operations.</p>

<!-- <p><i>{Do you want to Expunge without being prompted for a
confirmation? <a href="">Click here</a> to change that configuration
option. [not implemented yet]}</i>
cgi_p
{<i><a href="">Click here</a> to enable aggregate commands to have
this option available on this page. [not implemented yet]</i>}</p> -->


cgi_anchor_name "save">[cgi_bold "Saving messages to another folder"]</a><br>
"Save Messages" is only available from your Message List page when all of
your aggregate operations are showing.  If you do not see "Save Messages"  
on the top right-hand side of your page, some of your aggregate operations
are hidden. Click the tab to the left of your sort column headings to show
all of them.

Select the checkboxes next to the messages you want to save to
another folder.  Alongside the [cgi_bold "Save"] button, type in the name of the
folder to which you want the messages saved.  The folder name can be one
that already exists, or you can create a new folder by typing in a new
name. If you have folder collections, select the correct one using the
dropdown menu.  Select [cgi_bold "Save"] to save the message(s) into the folder
you have typed.

cgi_p
The messages in your current folder that you have saved to another
will be flagged for deletion.</p>


cgi_anchor_name "flags">[cgi_bold "Setting status flags"]</a><br>
Immediately to the left of your message numbers is an underscore
reserved for your status flags:
cgi_button_list {
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "+"] message sent directly to your address (your address was in the To: line)"
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "*"] important message"
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "A"] answered message"
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "N"] new (unread) message"
  cgi_li "[cgi_bold "D"] flagged for deletion (additionally the subject line will have a strike through it)"
</ul>

cgi_p {
  Select the underscore to go to a page where you can set or unset any of 
  your message status flags.
}

cgi_anchor_name "search"
cgi_puts {
  [cgi_bold "Searching"][cgi_nl]
  You can search through your messages in your Message List using the
  [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] dropdown menu.  If you do not see the menu
  (to the left of your sort column headings), some of your aggregate
  commands are hidden. Click the tab in that area to show more commands.
}

cgi_p {
  Select one of the menu items under [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] to 
  find messages:
}
cgi_bullet_list {
  cgi_li [cgi_italic "...by text"]
  cgi_li [cgi_italic "...by date"]
  cgi_li [cgi_italic "...by status"] 
}

cgi_puts {
  Specify your search criteria on the next page. After you make your
  selection, you will return to your Message List and the checkbox will be
  selected for those messages found in your search.
}

cgi_p {
  If you want to display just those messages that were found in your
  search, next select [cgi_bold "Zoom"] from the [cgi_bold "Search/Mark..."] menu list.  
  (Be aware that if you had other messages checked for selection before your
  search, they will also be included in your zoomed view).
}

if {0} {
<!-- <p><i>Note: If your browser is not javascript-enabled, after you make
your selection from the dropdown menu you will need to select the
<b>Do</b> button.</i></p> -->
