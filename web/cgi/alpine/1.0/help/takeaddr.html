<P>

Use <b>Take</b> to capture addresses from your current email message and
put them into your address book.  All the email addresses contained within
your message will be listed as choices for entry into your address book.

<p>

<p> Click the check-box next to the address or addresses you would like to
take to your address book.  Click one check-box if you want to add just
that single address.  Click more than one check-box to create a group
mailing list, which will link those addresses to one nickname in
your address book. After you make your selection, click <b>Take
Address</b> to then complete your address book entry, or click
<b>Cancel</b> to return to your email message without altering anything.

<p> If you have more than one address book, you will see a pull-down menu.
Use that menu to select among your defined address books.
