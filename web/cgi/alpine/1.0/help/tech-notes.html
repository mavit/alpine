<h2>Why Web Alpine</h2>

Web Alpine was originally conceived as a means of providing reliable,
ubiquitous, and consistent access to UW email facilites via the Interactive
Message Access Protocol (IMAP).  As with Pine, it is intended to present a
simple, approachable interface that can be easily navigated with
minimal familiarity.  It is also intended to be as efficient as
possible, in both page-service and user navigation while meshing
as neatly as possible with the central campus IMAP infrastructure.

<p>

<h2>How Web Alpine</h2>

<p>

Web Alpine's foundation rests firmly on Unix Alpine's many years of
development and deployment.  It's core element is a per-session server
(or serverette) that provides data to the scripts generating the web
pages the users sees and manages the connection to the IMAP mail
server where the user's mail resides.  This serverette is literally
built from the same Alpine sources used to build the Unix Alpine and
PC-Alpine mail user agents.  Thus, it inherits most of the efficiency,
such as data caching and request ordering and grouping, that has been
built into Alpine, as well as many of the features and functions.

<h3>Web Alpine Distribution Layout</h3>
<p>
The Web Alpine application consists of three main components; the CGI scripts that generate pages containing the user's email data,
a serverette running on the http server spanning the life of the user's session, and a couple of libraries
to aid page generation and serverette communciation.

<p>
Web Alpine is packaged as part of the Alpine Distribution and it's source resides
within the <tt>web/</tt> subdirectory.  Subdirectories are organized by the service
the provide, and breakdown as follows:
<p>
<table border=0 xbgcolor="#dddddd" align=center width="90%" cellpadding=2>
<tr>
 <td valign=top><tt>bin/</tt></td>

<h2>Web Alpine Configuration</h2>
<h3>CGI Script Configuration</h3>
<p>
Most Web Alpine configuration is contained in the <tt>config/alpine.tcl</tt> configuration file.
Most of the interesting settings are toward the top of the file and pretty much suggest
what they set.  The most important settings, though, are probably:

<table width="80%" align=center>
<tr><td>
<dl width=80%>
<dt>
 <tt>_wp(fileroot)</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
that defines where the Web Alpine application was unpacked on your system, and 
</dd>
<dt>
<tt>_wp(urlprefix)</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
which defines where browsers can find Web Alpine's CGI scripts.  This is set to
the null string if the server's DocumentRoot is synonymous with the root of
Web Alpine's CGI directory.  Othewise, it's typically set to the Alias accessed
subdirectory in the web server's configuration.

</dd>
</dl>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Web Server Configuration</h3>
<p>
Typically, a Web Alpine server is used solely to serve Web Alpine pages.  That is, no other hosting is
done by the server.  Thus, it is usually convenient to configure the web server to treat
the <tt>web/cgi/</tt> directory within the distribution as the root directory of the pages
it serves (or to move those files and directories into the web server's document root).
Similarly, it may be necessary to configure the web server to process CGI scripts from
it's root (since this <em>should</em> be a dedicated server this shouldn't matter).

<h3>IMAP Server Configuration</h3>
<p>
Genarally, no configuration is required of the IMAP server.
<table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
However, in the Pubcookie case the Web and IMAP servers need to coordinate the
existence of a meta-user, such as <tt>webalpine</tt>, used for SASL proxy authentication.  For UW imapd this
means creating an account on the IMAP server that is a member of the <tt>&quot;mailadm&quot;</tt>
group.  A SASL GSSAPI authentication handshake is used between the
Web and IMAP server when the web server initiates a session on behalf of
a particular user.
</td></tr></table>

<h3>User Configuration</h3>
<p>
Since no user-initiated local file or mailbox access is permitted by (much less compiled into) the <tt>alpined</tt>,
user configuration and data files are stored using Pine's remote pinerc and address book capabilites.  The configuration
settings in <tt>web/config/</tt> are used to set per-user defaults and direct Web Alpine toward the user's configuration
settings on the IMAP server.  Similarly, the default addressbook is stored as an IMAP folder on the server as well.
Concurrent Web Alpine, Unix Pine and PC-Pine users that would like a consistent mail environment can easily configure their
other Pine's to use the <tt>remote_pinerc</tt> and <tt>remote_addrbook</tt> on their IMAP server.

<h3>Browser Configuration</h3>
<p>
A Web Alpine goal is to run reasonably on as many browsers as possible.  Toward that end, little beyond basic table and form support
is required of the browser.  And while Javascript is not a requirement to access Web Alpine functions, when enabled in the browser
some enhanced capability is available such as keyboard accessible commands and implicit selection of various listbox choices.

<h2>Session Lifecycle</h2>
<p>

<ol>
 <li>User requests <tt>greeting.tcl</tt> which consists of a form to be filled out with any necessary authentication tokens and mail server choice.
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
In Pubcookie case user is not presented the username/password option unless they have chosen to
connect to a mail server outside the locally managed, predefined set.
 </td></tr></table>
 <li>User submits form with authentication tokens and initial mail server
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
By default, the submitted authentication tokens consist of a username/password pair.  When Pubcookie is
in use, the browser sends the pubcookie-specific authentication token with the form submission.
 </td></tr></table>

 <li>Web Alpine CGI logon script processes form and instantiates serverette.  The logon script:
  <ol>
   <li>validates form data
   <li>generates session key
   <li>launches the Web Alpine serverette, <tt>alpined</tt>, passing session key via stdin
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
<tt>serverette</tt> reads session key, creates Unix domain socket, and enters command loop
waiting for input on the fresh socket
 </td></tr></table>
   <li>sends serverette the command to establish a session with the requested IMAP server on behalf of the given user
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
By default, the login script simply passes the username/password pair to the serverette where
it's the serverette's job to present them to the IMAP server for validation.  If the IMAP server
declines, a "bad user or password" error page is generated and sent to the browser and the serverette
 exits.
<p>
The Pubcookie case is a bit more involved.  The CGI scripts rely on the netid specified in the REMOTE_USER
environment variable which is set as a side effect of pubcookie module processing.  The trusted netid
is not passed directly to the serverette, rather all CGI processing is done via a setuid Tcl interpreter.
The uid is unique to each netid on the system, but not related to any netid/uid binding on general access
systems.  Running the CGI scripts and serverette under a netid-bound uid provides a convenient way to implement
the authentication mechanism between the serverette and the IMAP server as well as a useful way to partition
serverettes such that one compromised serverette can't affect others.
 </td></tr></table>

   <li>With a valid IMAP session established, the logon script redirects the user's browser to the initial
    Message List page.
  </ol>
 <li>The user navigates/manipulates their email environment based on web pages generated by Tcl script
templates which were fleshed out via requests to the <tt>alpined</tt> serverette.  The serverette in turn
may draw on its cache of IMAP data, make new requests of the IMAP server, post messages via SMTP or
the local mail queue, formulate LDAP queries, or perform other tasks as required.
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
Note: Web Alpine sessions run as long as the user's browser requests pages.  In the absense of user interaction
Web Alpine will self-refresh every few minutes to mainain the session.  Sessions only end when the user logs out
or closes the browser.
 </td></tr></table>
 <li>User ends session and confirms 
 <table width="75%" align=center bgcolor="#dddddd"><tr><td>
  Note: If the user simply closes their browser, the serverette will self-exit after 30 minutes.
 </td></tr></table>
</ol>

<h3>Web Server Considerations</h3>
<p>
Web Alpine has been developed under Apache (versions 1.x thru 2.x).  However, because the intent was to be as flexible
and manageable as possible, little aside from SSL and basic CGI services are required of the web server.  It's
conceivable Web Alpine could be made to run under another server, or even Windows and IIS modulo the UNIX-Sockets communication 
issues between the CGI scripts and <tt>alpined</tt>.

<p>
The downside, of course, is that this requires somewhat redundant 
parses of the configuration and CGI-helper library with each page request.  It's a trade-off.  A slightly more efficient approach might be to create
an apache module that understands requests and passes them directly to the corresponding <tt>alpined</tt> which would execute the script and return
HTML directly. However, the additional cost in installation and management complexity stands to offset those gains.

<p>
Similarly, it is <bold>assumed</bold> that the Web Alpine service is provided on a black box server.  That is, a host
that has no general user accounts.  Unmodified, Web Alpine creates the UNIX-domain sockets corresponding 
pretty directly to the user's session key in the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory.  In addition, depending on the nature
of the connection, the session key may also be exposed via oridinary httpd logging.  <em>Important safety tip:</em> make
sure ordinary users do not have access to the Web Alpine system or httpd log files.  In the future those sockets may be moved into 
a access-restricted subdirectory, but the httpd log file record may be harder, and less reliably concealed.

<h3>CGI Considerations</h3>
<p>

Most Web Alpine pages are generated via CGI scripts written in Tcl.  A
library of Tcl functions called <tt>cgi.tcl</tt> is used heavily to
help with the HTML generation.  Of course, this means that a web 
developer that might wish to change or enhance Web Alpine pages, will have
to acquire some Tcl knowledge.  Additionally, the library has one or two
interface inconsistencies (not unlike Tcl, but that's another
discussion), which will mean a bit steeper learning curve, but we 
think this is only slightly more difficult than the amount of Tcl
one would have to learn in a more template-oriented approach.  We think
the scipt's logic flow and such is much easier to understand
and maintain than the substitution and recursion necessary in an
html-template approach.

<p>


<h3><span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: big">alpined</span> Considerations</h3>
<p>
Tcl, incidentally, is also the language used to move data in and out
of the Web Alpine serverette, <tt>alpined</tt>.  Tcl lends itself nicely
to string oriented data, and provides a convenient, simple interface
to export functionality contained in C-based utilities.

<h3>HTML Considerations</h3>
<p>
Much of the HTML generated by Web Alpine does layout based on tables.  This somewhat sub-optimal state
mostly has to do with when the Web Alpine development effort was initiated and the concurrent browser
chaos.  The goal is to move scripts toward generating more CSS-oriented layout over time.

<p>
Similarly, earlier versions of Web Alpine relied heavily on Javascript in a misguided attempt to make the
browser-based experience feel as familiar as possible to a dedicated desktop application.  Beyond the fact that
Javascript support varied widely across browsers at the time, it should have also been obvious that
by presenting a familiar desktop-like interface, we also set desktop-like performance
expectations which we had no hope of meeting.

<h3>Clustering Considerations</h3>
<p>
Since <tt>alpined</tt> persists for the life of the user's session, the session is bound to the particular
server that initiated it.  In order to provide service to a sizeable constituency, it may be necessary to spread usage across
a group or cluster of servers.  There exist numerous strategies to distribute connecting users across a cluster, such
as an initial server that redirects randomly to one of the servers in a cluster, DNS-based randomizing, or load-balancing 
strategies.  The former can lead to web server names users find distracting (though this doesn't appear to be to 
much of an issue) and the latter, of course, could lead to misdirected requests over time (or as loads change) so
it is necessary for servers to either redirect or proxy requests to the appropriate server.
<p>
As a basic allowance for such installations, Web Alpine's session key
contains the hostname of the server that created it.  Similarly, the
access routines that parse the key for access to the appropriate
<tt>alpined</tt> are aware of the hostname and will redirect
misguided requests to the appropriate server.  This isn't particularly
satisfying in terms of network RTTs.
<p>
One alternative that saves network performance
at the expense of slightly increased server load is to introduce a
directory above the <tt>web alpine/</tt> script directory and then add one
along side that new directory for each server in the cluster.  It's then possible to use the Apache
directive to proxy requests within the scope of those directories to
the corresponding server.

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Session keys only valid for life of session.  Can't acquire increased or prolonged rights based on key.
<li>Link layer (ssl) encryption available (and likely the default in most situations)
<li><tt>alpined</tt> pseudo-uid partitioning is employed in the pubcookie context
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
Through the semi-formal usability testing process, early testing
phases and regular campus use, overall response has been very  favorable.
Usability testing concurrent with ongoing feature development and interface adjustments 
continues to hone rough edges, particularly where the drive for performance has led to
less intuitive interface choices.  We plan to continue emphasis on the refine/feedback
loop as we roll in many of the features Pine users have come to appreciate.

<p>
Performance in terms of both user perceived response time and users per web server are 
always a concern, but must, of course, be balanced against additional maintenance and complexity costs.
Less obvious complicating factors must be considered, such as <tt>alpined</tt> process partitioning
and session-key containing cookie exposure in the face of malicous HTML attachments.
We plan, of course, to continue exploring various methods to improve performance.

<h2>Appendix: Installation Tests</h2>
<p>
For the most part, if you can get the login greeting page and
then log into a session, things should be working for the
most part. Some things you might try to verify
a complete installation include:

<ul>
<li>Open a secondary folder</li>
<li>Go back to Inbox</li>
<li>View or Save an attachment</li>
<li>Send a message</li>
<li>Send a message with an attachment</li>
<li>Spell check a message (if is ispell installed on the web server)</li>
<li>Create an address book entry</li>
<li>Delete an address book entry</li>
<li>Save a message to a new folder</li>
<li>Verify the new folder appears in the cached folder drop down</li>
<li>Logout, Verify the folder appears in drop down list of subsequent session</li>
<li>Try configuration settings such as Enable Full Headers</li>
<li>Logout, Verify the setting change in subsequent session</li>
</ul>
