<a name="navigate"><b>Navigating your messages</b></a><p>
In the far left column of the Message View screen, there are four navigation options: <b>Previous</b>, <b>First</b>, <b>Next</b>,
<b>Last</b>.  Click:
<table border=0 cellpadding=4 style="margin-left:24">
 <tr>
   <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_prev3.gif" alt="Previous"></td>
   <td>to go to the previous message in this folder</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_first3.gif" alt="First"></td>
  <td>to go to the first message in this folder</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_next3.gif" alt="Next"></td>
   <td>to go the next message in this folder</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="../../images/but_rnd_last3.gif" alt="Last"></td>
  <td> to go to the last message in this folder</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>

With most broswsers and the usual settings, you also have the option of
using keyboard controls for some of your navigation.  You may, however,
need to first click in your Alpine window to make sure that your system
knows which screen is active.

<p>The keyboard controls are:
<table border=0 cellspacing=12 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td text align="center">n</td>
  <td>next message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">p</td>
  <td>previous message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">i</td>
  <td>return to message index</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">c</td>
  <td>compose new message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">l</td>
  <td>list folder</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">d</td>
  <td>flag message as deleted</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">u</td>
  <td>unflag message as deleted</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">a</td>
  <td>go to address book</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">r</td>
  <td>reply to current message</td></tr>
<tr><td text align="center">f</td>
  <td>forward current message</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<a name="attach"><b>Viewing attachments</b></a><p> 
When a message includes an attachment, you will see highlighted links
under the heading "Parts/Attachments."  Click either "View" or the link
description to see the attachment. Click "Save" to
download the attachment.

<p>The attachment links also allow you to read messages delivered as HTML.  
Simply view the second attachment to display the message as intended.

<p>If you cannot view your attachments, go to 
<b>Configuration</b>
 and click the Message View tab.  Make sure "Enable Attachments View" is marked.</p>
<p>

<a name="reply"><b>Replying to the message</b></a><p>
Use <input type=submit value="Reply"> to respond to the author of the message and/or to the
other recipients who were sent the original message.

<p>To respond to all original recipients, check "<input type=checkbox checked> To All" and then click 
<input type=submit value="Reply">.</p>

<p>By default, "Include text" will be checked.  If you do not want to
include the previous text in your reply, remove that checkmark before you
click  <input type=submit value="Reply">.</p>


<a name="forward"><b>Forwarding the message</b></a><p>
Use <input type=submit value="Forward"> to send the message you are
viewing to someone else.
You will need to supply the email address of the new recipient on the
subsequent Message Compose screen.</p>



<a name="save"><b>Saving the message to another folder</b></a><p>

Save the message you are viewing to another folder by choosing from
the options in the dropdown menu next to the
<input type=submit value="Save"> button.  Among the Save options,
you'll find

<ul>
 <li> The name of the default folder to save to, typically <font face="courier">saved-messages</font>.
 <li> Several, typically six, names of folders you have most recently saved messages to
 <li> An option to type in directly the name of the folder you wish to save to (either a new folder you wish to create, or one
already containing messages)
 <li> An option to choose the folder from the list of all your folders
</ul>

If Alpine does not act on your choice immediately, click the <input type=submit value="Save">
button to initiate saving.  Once saved, the chosen messages will be marked for deletion.


<p>
<a name="take"><b>Adding addresses directly to address book</b></a></p>
Click <input type=submit value="Take"> on the top panel of 
your screen to go to a listing of all the email addresses contained within 
this message.  Click next to any or all of those addresses to add them 
to your addressbook.<p>

<a name="header"><b>Displaying full headers</b></a><p> 
Click the <img src="../../images/hdr.gif" alt="display full headers"> icon 
near the top right of your screen to view your full headers.  The full
headers contain information about the path taken by this email message. To
return to digested headers, click <img src="../../images/hdrnon.gif" alt="display digested headers">.<p>


<a name="print"><b>Printing</b></a><p>
Click the <img src="../../images/printer2.gif" alt="print"> icon near the top 
right 
of your screen to print your message.

<p>If you lose the right edge of your message, you may want to decrease 
your font size:

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Configure</b>
<li>Click the "General" tab on the subsequent screen
<li>Choose "small font" or "smallest font" from the drop down box next to 
<b>Font Size?</b>
</ol>


<p><a name="jump"><b>Jump Command (optional)</b></a><p>

Depending on your configuration, you may also see a text box next to a 
<input type=submit value="Jump"> button on the left side of the page.  Enter a
message number into the text box and click the button to have that message
number's text displayed.


<p><a name="note"><b>Differences from Pine and PC-Pine</b></a><p>

<p>Alpine is designed primarily for easy access to email.  It is not
intended to replace any other heavy duty email programs.  Accordingly, it
is missing some of the more advanced features you will find in Pine and
PC-Pine. As development continues, features will be added as long as they
do not make a large impact on Alpine's speed or efficiency.

<p> Some of the features you will not currently find in Alpine Message 
View:
<ul>
<li>Change message status (available on Message List page)
<li>Bounce
<li>Go directly to a specific folder (may be added soon)
<li>Where is (instead, use your browser's "find" command)
<li>Export message
</ul>
</form>
