# If the server's connecting port isn't secure (https), then
# redirect request to same location but such that the communication
# is secure.  NOTE: this isn't as secure as turning off the unsecure
# port because any confidential information in the request is exposed
# in the unsuspecting request on the unsecure port.  Shouldn't really
# be a problem since the secure content should only contain secure
# references and the likelihood that a client mucks with the url into
# a reference to secure content is pretty darn small.
